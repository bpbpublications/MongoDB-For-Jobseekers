# Chapter 17: MongoDB Atlas – Application Services

We will be building a React app using Atlas App Services which allows us to build on top of MongoDB, without actually having to run or maintain our own Replica Set, or server. Rather, we will rely on a shared free MongoDB Cluster, Atlas Functions, the Realm SDK for Web and the Atlas’ Data API.
