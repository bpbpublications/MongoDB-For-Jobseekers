# Chapter 18: Jobseeker – Interview Prep

This chapter will present fifty different interview-like questions, at various levels of difficulty, as well as a response. These may not be the exact questions you would be asked in an interview, for which MongoDB skills are required, but you can expect to be asked some variation of them. For each question, a response is offered, as well as a reference to the chapter we discussed the topic in general, or directly. We will discuss how to use this chapter’s questions in the next section.
