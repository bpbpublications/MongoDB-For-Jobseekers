# Chapter 5: Letâ€™s Do It - Create, Update and Delete Documents

By the end of this chapter, you will have a basic idea of how to create, update and delete documents within MongoDB. We will also discuss how to do each of these actions to multiple documents at one time.

```javascript
var sandwich = {
  name: "Tuna",
  bread: "wheat",
  ingredients: [
    { name: "meat", type: "tuna salad" },
    { name: "cheese", type: "swiss" },
  ],
  price: 7.4,
};
```
